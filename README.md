# fetch-cuties

Inside the `my-app` folder is a bootstrapped Create-React-App. 

This is a repo created to practice getting images with 2 different fetching methods. 

### Instructions
Create a SPA with 2 client side routes:
- One that will fetch a random image of a kitty from `http://placekitten.com/` when a button is pressed using the browserâ€™s fetch api.
- One that will fetch a random image of a puppy from `https://place-puppy.com/` when a button is pressed using the axios library.
